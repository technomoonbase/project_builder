# Standard Project Structure for Bug Bounty

1. **README.md**
   - **Objective**: A clear, concise statement of the project's aim.
   - **Scope**: Defined boundaries of the target as per the client's specification.
   - **Use**: Guidelines on how to use the project's content, including tools, scripts, and findings.

2. **Reconnaissance Directory**
   - Subdirectories for each target, e.g., web, network, API, etc.
   - Files for collected data like IPs, domain names, port scan results, etc.
   - Scripts used for automating recon tasks and their documentation.

3. **Research Directory**
   - Notes on potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations found during recon.
   - Any related resources or documentation supporting the research.

4. **Vulnerabilities and Exploits Directory**
   - Detailed reports on identified vulnerabilities, including proof of concept.
   - Subdirectories for different categories of vulnerabilities.
   - Exploit code (if any) and an explanation of how it operates within the defined scope.

5. **Results/Reporting Directory**
   - Drafts and final versions of submitted reports.
   - Templates for reports based on the client's requirements.
   - Feedback from submitted reports and steps taken in response.

6. **Tools and Scripts Directory**
   - Custom scripts developed for the project.
   - Documentation for each tool/script, including usage instructions.
   - Any necessary credentials or configuration files (stored securely).

7. **Assets Directory**
   - Non-code assets, such as screenshots, video captures, or other proof materials.
   - Organized by vulnerability or target for easy reference.

8. **Legal/Compliance Directory**
   - Copies of contracts, rules of engagement, and legal considerations.
   - Logs of actions taken during the project for auditing purposes.

### Reporting Expectations

1. **Executive Summary**: A non-technical overview of the findings for managerial staff.
2. **Technical Report**: A detailed description of the findings for the security team, including vulnerability impact and reproduction steps.
3. **Remediation Suggestions**: Proposed solutions or mitigation strategies for each identified vulnerability.
4. **Proof of Concept**: Evidence demonstrating the vulnerability, which could include code, screenshots, or videos.
5. **Appendix**: Any additional information that supports the report, such as code snippets, tool outputs, or reference material.

The best way integrates adaptability into the framework, allowing the structure to evolve as the project's needs change. With this dynamic setup, we're not just building a project, we're crafting an experience that carries our ethical banner forward. We are not just hunting bugs; we are also mentoring through methodology, nurturing the landscape we traverse.
